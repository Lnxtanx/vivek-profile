        <h1>My Journey of Building a Game in C Language</h1>
    </header>

        <h2>The Story Behind the Game</h2>
        <p>
            On November 27, 2024, while in my first semester, I made an interesting decision. Instead of attending my Chemistry practical exam, I spent the day building a simple yet fun game in the C programming language. 
            The game involves random numbers, user interaction, and some creative math. The very next day, I gave my Chemistry practical exam, but I was thrilled with what I had built in C.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            The game starts by asking the player to think of a number, take a number from a friend, and then interactively add a random number provided by the program. The game concludes with a fun math trick to reveal the player's final number. 
            Itâ€™s a simple game but highlights the power of logical thinking and programming skills in C.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Build the Game</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn the basics of the C language, including variables, conditional statements, loops, and user input.</li>
            <li>Use the <code>stdio.h</code> library for input and output operations.</li>
            <li>Use the <code>stdlib.h</code> and <code>time.h</code> libraries to generate random numbers.</li>
            <li>Structure your program with clear steps and conditional checks to guide the player through the game.</li>
            <li>Compile and test the program using a C compiler like GCC or an IDE like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>About C Language</h2>
        <p>
            C is a powerful, high-performance programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, game development, and more. 
            C is known for its simplicity, portability, and speed, making it a favorite among beginners and professionals alike. Key features of C include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low-level access:</strong> Allows working closely with the system hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Known for producing fast and optimized code.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Programs written in C can be easily adapted to other platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Suitable for applications ranging from small utilities to large systems like operating systems.</li>
        </ul>
